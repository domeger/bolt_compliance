    name: "Check Windows Firewall: Private: Logging: Log dropped packets' is set to 'Yes'"
    description:
      Use this option to log when Windows Firewall with Advanced Security discards an inbound
      packet for any reason. The log records why and when the packet was dropped. Look for
      entries with the word DROP in the action column of the log.
    rationale:
      If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of
      system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.
    impact: 1.0
