    name: Give the Apache User Account an Invalid Shell
    description:
      The apache account must not be used as a regular login account and should be assigned
      an invalid or nologin shell to ensure that the account cannot be used to login.
    rationale:
      Service accounts such as the apache account represent a risk if they can be used
      to get a login shell to the system.
